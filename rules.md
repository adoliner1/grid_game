# Shapes And Tiles

## Objective
Have the most points at the end of the game. The game ends when all tiles have a ruler at the end of a round or at the end of the 6th round.

## Start of a round
Each player receives: 2 circles, 1 square, and 1 triangle.

## During a round
On a player's turn they may take one of these actions:

1. **Place a shape from storage onto a slot on a tile.** There is a shape hierarchy. Circles < Squares < Triangles. Circles can only be placed in empty slots. Squares can be placed in empty slots, and on top of circles. Triangles can be placed on everything except other triangles. Trumped shapes (the shape that was placed on) go to the powerups section. See **Trumping and the Powerups**.
2. **Use a tile**.
3. **Use a powerup.**
4. **Pass**. After passing, you won't be able to take any more actions that round (you can still take reactions). If you're the first player to pass in a round, you become first player for the next round.

A round ends when both players have passed. 

## Ruling
Each tile has some criteria which determines who rules that tile (if anyone). The ruler gains some benefit (normally) from being ruler. 

## Round Bonuses
Each round has a bonus. Points are given to players that fulfill the given condition.

## Conversions
At any time on a player's turn, they may perform conversions with their shapes in storage at the following rates. Performing a conversion does not count as performing an action:

- 3 circles to 1 square
- 3 squares to 1 triangle
- 1 square to 1 circle
- 1 triangle to 1 square

## Trumping and the Powerups
When a shape is placed on (trumped) it may be placed by the owning player in their powerups section.

## Miscellaneous

When multiple tiles are resolving effects at the same time, they happen in this order:

0 1 2 
3 4 5 
6 7 8

When both players are due to resolve some effect at the same time, the first player resolves them first. 

Some tiles use adjacency. In the above grid, 0 is adjacent to 1 and 3, but not to 4. 

Producing a shape means: add to your storage.

Burning a shape removes it from the game. It doesn't go to the powerups section.

End of round effects happen before end of round bonuses are calculated.

Moving/Placing/Receiving are different i.e. if you receive a shape on a tile it will not trigger on place or on move effects.
