Client:
    -tiles and powerups taking up too much space 
    -iconography

Server:
    -Nitrogen: order of burning matters
    -data structure that describes when a piece of data is resettable and has a directive i.e. "Choose a slot on a tile to place on"
    -more powerups
    -undoing

Both:
    -host it/the way connecting works right now is jank
    -show base income changes next to round bonus, if it's not constant
    -separation between powerups/and tiles needs clarity. 
    -theme
